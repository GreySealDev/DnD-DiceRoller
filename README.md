# DnD-DiceRoller
A simple text-based dice roller for tabletop RPGs and board games.

One of my first Python projects! It is inspired by Al Sweigart's _The Big Book of Small Python Projects_, but the implementation as well as additional features (roll history) are mine.

Choose the amount of dice as well as the type and the modifier (e.g.: 2d20, 6d8+1) and roll away! A history of the ten most recent rolls is also easily accessible. Have fun!
